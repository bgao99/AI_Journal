Week 2
This week, I used ChatGpt to check my answers for Excercise 2. It helped to correct some mistakes and typos.
Since our group decided to create a search engine, I asked AI to compare our ideal product to the existing search enegines.
It gave me the pros and cons of our search engine, and it would help us to improve our objectives and building it.
In addition, I asked ChatGPT how it would think on the discussion topic because it was related the AI. I added its response to my post.
